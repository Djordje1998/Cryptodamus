# Cryptodamus

A cryptocurrency price prediction tool that uses pattern recognition in historical price data to forecast future price movements.

## Overview

Cryptodamus analyzes historical price patterns to identify similar trends that might predict future price movements. Named after Nostradamus, it attempts to see the future through patterns of the past.

## Core Concepts

The prediction engine works through several key steps:

1. **Pattern Analysis**
   - Calculates percentage deviations from moving averages
   - Identifies similar patterns using delta analysis
   - Scores pattern matches based on similarity

2. **Price Prediction**
   - Ranks historical patterns by match quality
   - Projects future prices using percentage changes
   - Returns multiple possible price trajectories

3. **Accuracy Evaluation**
   - Measures prediction accuracy against actual prices
   - Calculates mean and maximum errors
   - Reports accuracy within specified tolerance
