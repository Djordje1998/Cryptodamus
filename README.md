# Cryptodamus

A cryptocurrency price prediction application that implements pattern recognition techniques to analyze historical price data. Built in Clojure with a Swing GUI interface.

## Overview

This application analyzes historical cryptocurrency price patterns to identify similar sequences that may indicate future price movements. The system uses statistical pattern matching to find historical periods with similar price behavior and projects their outcomes forward.

## Algorithm Implementation

### Core Pattern Recognition Process

1. **Data Normalization**
   - Zero anchoring: Subtracts first price from all prices in sequence
   - Relative percent change: Calculates percentage changes relative to first element
   - Delta average: Computes percentage deviation from sequence average
   - Price differences: Element-wise differences between consecutive prices
   - Log returns: Logarithmic returns for volatility analysis

2. **Pattern Matching**
   - Chunk Window (CW): Size of historical patterns to compare
   - Skip Window (SW): Step size when sliding through historical data
   - Significance threshold: Maximum allowed difference for pattern matches
   - Delta difference analysis: Compares normalized patterns using statistical differences
   - Pattern scoring: Assigns numerical scores (0-100) based on similarity

3. **Price Prediction**
   - Identifies top N most similar historical patterns
   - Projects future prices using percentage changes from historical outcomes
   - Prediction Window (PW): Number of future data points to predict
   - Returns multiple predictions ranked by pattern match quality

4. **Validation**
   - Backtesting using train/test data splits
   - Calculates mean absolute percentage error and maximum error
   - Evaluates accuracy within specified tolerance ranges
   - Parameter optimization through grid search

## Implementation Details

### Data Source
- CoinGecko API for historical price data
- Supported cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Monero
- Configurable date ranges with timestamp validation
- API key authentication through configuration file

### User Interface
- JFreeChart-based price visualization
- Calendar-based date selection
- Real-time chart updates with multiple prediction trajectories
- Optional overlay of actual future prices for validation

#### Parameters
- **CW (Chunk Window)**: Size of historical price sequences to compare. Larger values capture longer-term patterns but require more data
- **SW (Skip Window)**: Number of data points to advance when sliding through historical data. Smaller values provide more overlapping comparisons
- **PW (Predict Window)**: Number of future price points to forecast. Limited by available historical outcomes
- **Significance**: Maximum allowed statistical difference for pattern matches. Lower values require more similar patterns
- **Number of Predictions**: How many top-ranked predictions to display, sorted by pattern match quality

### Technical Features
- Automatic parameter optimization
- Multiple mathematical normalization approaches
- Backtesting framework for accuracy evaluation
- Primitive array operations for performance
- Configurable numerical precision

## Setup

### Requirements
- Java 8+
- Leiningen
- CoinGecko API key

### Configuration
1. Copy `resources/config.edn.example` to `resources/config.edn`
2. Add API key:
```clojure
{:api-keys {:coingecko "your-api-key"}}
```

### Running
```bash
# Development
lein run

# Production build
lein uberjar
java -jar target/cryptodamus-*-standalone.jar
```

## Usage

1. Select cryptocurrency (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Monero)
2. Set date range for historical data
3. Configure parameters:
   - CW (Chunk Window): Pattern size
   - SW (Skip Window): Step size
   - PW (Predict Window): Future points
   - Significance: Similarity threshold
   - Number of Predictions: Output count
4. Generate predictions or use automatic optimization

### Chart Interpretation
- Blue: Historical prices
- Red: Predicted trajectories (with confidence scores)
- Green: Actual future prices (validation mode)

## Architecture

### Modules
- `core.clj`: Prediction algorithms and mathematical functions
- `fetch.clj`: CoinGecko API integration
- `utils.clj`: Date/time utilities and configuration
- `gui.clj`: Swing GUI interface

### Key Components
- Pattern recognition using statistical analysis
- Delta analysis for normalized sequence comparison
- Scoring system combining average and maximum differences
- Backtesting framework for validation

## Limitations
- Requires minimum historical data (chunk window size)
- Accuracy varies with market conditions
- Limited to three supported cryptocurrencies
- Subject to API rate limits
